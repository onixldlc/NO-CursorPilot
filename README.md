# NO-CursorPilot

A mod that turns your **Nuclear Option** into a more arcade-y game control. In short this mod allows you to fly your aircraft toward where the orbit camera is looking.

>[!NOTE]
> This preview uses 2 other mods: [ThirdPersonHUD](https://github.com/OverlordMIke/Nuclear-Option-Mod-ThirdPersonHUD) to show the HUD while in orbit camera mode, and [CustomOrbit](https://github.com/onixldlc/NO-CustomOrbit) so you can move the center point to the top of the jet while in orbit camera mode.

## Install

1. Install BepInEx 5 in the Nuclear Option game directory.
2. Drop `NO-CursorPilot.dll` into `/path/to/NO/BepInEx/plugins/`.
3. Launch the game. Cursor pilot is **ON by default** — press **F9** to toggle it off / back on.

## Hotkeys

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| F9       | Toggle cursor pilot on / off (default: ON at game start) |
| F1       | Reload `BepInEx/config/com.cursorpilot.NOCursorPilot.cfg` from disk |
| unbound  | `DumpKey` — dump telemetry buffer to BepInEx log (bind via config) |
| unbound  | `DumpProfileKey` — snapshot current PID + tuning to `BepInEx/config/NOCursorPilot.profiles/profile_<timestamp>.cfg` (bind via config) |

Auto-dump of telemetry on camera-mode change is enabled by default (`[Telemetry] DumpOnCameraModeChange = true`).

## Free Look behavior

Holding the game's **Free Look** key changes what the mod tracks. Two configurable behaviors via `[Flight] TurnToFreelook`:

- **`TurnToFreelook = false` (default)** — the moment you press Free Look, the mod snapshots the cursor-pilot target direction. While held you can mouse around freely; the plane stays committed to the saved spot. On release the camera animates back to that exact saved direction over `FreelookRecoverySeconds`, then a `FreelookGraceSeconds` window keeps the mod tracking the saved direction so no jerk happens when live-cam tracking resumes.
- **`TurnToFreelook = true`** — on release, plane immediately chases wherever the camera ended up (classic cursor-pilot chase).

Stick / keyboard flight input always wins over the mod — push the stick beyond a small threshold at any time and you regain manual control.

## How it works

Two Harmony patches.

### `CursorFlightPatch` — Postfix on `PilotPlayerState.PlayerAxisControls`

Each fixed-update tick (only when mod is enabled, aircraft is active, orbit cam is selected, and no UI / chat / map is open):

1. Reads camera forward — either live `cam.transform.forward` or the saved Free-Look snapshot, depending on state.
2. Smooths it with `TargetSmoothing` lambda (skipped during Free Look hold: snap to saved direction).
3. Projects a virtual fly-target `AimDistance` meters ahead of the plane.
4. Transforms the target into the aircraft's local frame; the resulting `(x, y)` becomes yaw / pitch error.
5. Computes `angleOff` from the plane's **velocity direction** (not nose forward) so the controller closes the lag between nose attitude and actual flight path.
6. Roll error blends between wings-level and target-x by `AggressiveTurnAngle`.
7. Three PID controllers (P = 1 fixed, Ki shared, Kd per axis) produce pitch / roll / yaw commands.
8. Output is smoothed (`OutputSmoothing` lambda) then written to `ControlInputs`.
9. Holding stick beyond a small threshold hands control back to the player at any time.

### `CameraOrbitPatch` — Transpiler + Postfix on `CameraOrbitState`

Nuclear Option's orbit camera has three smoothing layers that interact badly with cursor piloting (camera self-drift, lag on input). A Harmony Transpiler replaces only those three call sites with no-op pass-throughs:

| Game line | Smoothing call | Replacement |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| `CameraMotion` line 170 | `Vector3.RotateTowards(flatVelSmoothed, target, ...)` | `target` (snap, no rate limit) |
| `CameraMotion` line 177 | `Vector3.SmoothDamp(followVector, flatVelSmoothed, ref cameraVelocity, viewSmoothing)` | `target` (snap, no damp) |
| `CameraMotion` line 182 | `Quaternion.Lerp(pivotRotationPrev, current, num*5)` (first Lerp only) | `current` (no low-pass on player input) |

Look-at-target Lerps (lines 214 / 227 / 230) are left untouched.

A Postfix on `UpdateState` handles two things:

- **Heading compensation** — subtracts the plane's per-frame yaw delta from `panView` so the camera stays world-absolute. The removed Lerp on line 182 used to provide implicit world-absolute lock via low-pass behavior; this discrete subtraction restores it without any filter (no drift source).
- **Free Look snapshot & recovery** — captures `cam.cameraPivot.rotation * forward` and `cam.transform.forward` at press transition. On release (when `TurnToFreelook = false`), lerps `panView` / `tiltView` back to values that reproduce the saved pivot direction given the plane's current heading. After recovery, a grace window keeps the mod tracking the saved cursor-pilot direction.

All three smoothing pass-throughs gate on `Plugin.Enabled` and call the original Unity functions when the mod is off, so disabling restores stock orbit-cam behavior.

## Tuning

See [TUNING.md](TUNING.md) for a symptom -> knob cheat sheet, recommended tuning order, and telemetry-dump interpretation guide.

Default config lives at `BepInEx/config/com.cursorpilot.NOCursorPilot.cfg` after first launch. Edit, save, press **F1** in game to apply without restarting.

Default PID tuning (`[Flight.PID]`):

| Key | Default |
|-----|---------|
| `Ki` | `0.05` |
| `IntegralLimit` | `1.0` |
| `KdPitch` | `0.18` |
| `KdYaw` | `0.15` |
| `KdRoll` | `-0.35` (note: negative) |

## Building

All builds run inside a Docker / Podman container — no host `dotnet` install required.

```bash
podman build -f Dockerfile.ci -t no-cursorpilot-build .
cid=$(podman create no-cursorpilot-build)
podman cp "$cid":/build/bin/Release/NO-CursorPilot.dll ./NO-CursorPilot.dll
podman rm "$cid"
```

Output: `NO-CursorPilot.dll` at the repo root (or `bin/Release/NO-CursorPilot.dll` inside the container).

The build references stub assemblies under `.github/ci/stubs/` containing just the signatures of game / Rewired types the mod calls. No proprietary game code is bundled.

## Disclaimer

>[!CAUTION]
> Real talk!. Since this mod will basically gives you extra awareness to your surrounding as this mods allows you to control your plane whilst not in the pilot seat you might want to ask other before using this mod as using it on public server might get you kicked, banned, or penalized, so *use it at your own risk!*

>[!NOTE]
> Hey if they can make [Nuke Thunder](https://warthunder.com/en/news/9983-event-nuclear-thunder-en) i don't see why we can't make `War Option`... tho that's probably a mobile game name so scratch that lol
